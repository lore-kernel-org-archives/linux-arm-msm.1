Hi Hans,
interesting discussion.

It seems that at least for these laptops, windows relies on a PEP
(Windows specific) power driver to setup initial clocks/power rails
then ACPI for peripherals if I understood correctly.

From my understanding this is not unique to ARM? After all, from my
experience s2idle on AMD is also configured using a PEP like driver on
Windows/Linux. A lot of the AMD platforms I tested rely on triggering
a specific mailbox on the SMU to enter s2idle instead of the modern
standby dsms. This is implemented by amd_pmc. Then hw vendors use the
DSMs for additional functionality such as disabling gamepads and
keyboard backlight.

In this RFC, you propose using a DP/ACPI hybrid to have the
configuration that should be performed by a platform driver be
performed by a DT instead. But this hybrid mode is only useful to
bring up these platforms and is not expected to help in the future. So
it is a lot of refactoring for not much gain?

Therefore, have you considered if a small qualcomm driver would be
realistic / possible where all it does is setup the configuration the
same way as its windows counterpart does? Would it be too big,
cumbersome etc, not worth the squeeze, where we should just stick with
DTs for these laptops and ameliorate this deficit on the BIOS side for
future laptops instead, since I understand some Qualcomm folk are
working on making newer laptop variants ACPI only and that is great.

Best,
Antheas
