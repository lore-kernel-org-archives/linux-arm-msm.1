Thanks for working on solving this problem, this looks cleaner than what 
I had in my presentation!

So the idea is that this can return false positives but, since everything is
done under the gpuvm lock which is taken by the shrinker as well, then 
it should never
return false negatives? Then I wonder why it mentions that running 
single pass
when two-pass should run will still be correct, it is obviously true but are
there cases where it can happen?

Everything looks good otherwise so might be able to give my Rb.
